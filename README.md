# BivariateScatter

I chose the variables of debt and income because they are possibly the two most important numbers when it comes to economic well-being for most Americans. Generally, my scatterplot suggests that a vast majority of people have a modest income and a low amount of debt, with richer people having more debt (though the amount of debt goes up at a much lower rate than the income).
